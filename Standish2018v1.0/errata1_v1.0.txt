Errata1_v1.0  3/10/2018

The following corrections apply to files in Standish2018v1.0. Bug 20180219-1 is
a one byte error which is nonetheless serious and must be corrected before using
the Standish module in the extended range 3000 BC to 3000 AD. These bugs will be squashed in future releases. Other bugs here are cosmetic or non-critical performance improvements that are recommended and will be later implimented.

Further errata may be issued for version 1.0, and should also be consulted.

Bug 20180207-01
Standish_Module.f90 V1.0
2/3/2018. Performance. Standish V1 Line 218 contains code "tz = eph(itbl)%o(13, np) * t ** 2 +"....
The use of exponentiation (t**2) is correct but far more costly than simple multiplication. New versions of code will contain the revision "tz = eph(itbl)%o(13, np) * t * t +".

Bug 20180207-02
Standish_module.f90 V1.0
2/3/2018. Technical Non-material error. Standish V1 Line 164 contains code "po = s_ZERO".
New versions of code will be revised to "p = s_ZERO".

Bug 20180207-03
Planets.f90 V1.0
2/3/2018. Cosmetic. Planets V1 Lines 28 and 28 contain the code "Write (, '(A10, 3F9.3,3F9.4)')".
The velocities are printed in KPS rather than AU/YR, and F9.4 display can be revised to F9.3. New versions of code will contain the revision "Write (, '(A10, 6F9.3)')", along with adjustments to the spacing of the column headers.

Bug 20180219-1 Standish Module V1.0, function tbl(jd)
function tbl selects which of the two Standish tables is to be used (1800AD-2050AD =>table 1, 3000BC-3000AD => table 2). Coding error caused selection of table 2 to fail, giving zero result for state vector. Line 197 therefore requires correction in Version 1.0

V1.0 line 197 Standish_module.f90 currently reads
If ((jd .Gt. eph(2)%jul1) .And. (jd .Lt. eph(2)%jul1)) tbl = 2
CORRECT TO
If ((jd .Gt. eph(2)%jul1) .And. (jd .Lt. eph(2)%jul2)) tbl = 2

Apologies, of course. Testing continues. This bug will be corrected in next release.
